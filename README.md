Virtual Pet Development Project: Reinforcement learning with Human Feedback

# Virtual Pet Development Project: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback

## 1. Objective
### Primary Objective
- Develop a virtual pet that can learn and perform specific actions (e.g., sitting, fetching) through the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) combined with human feedback.

### Secondary Objectives
- Evaluate the effectiveness of combining RL with human feedback versus using RL alone.
- Enhance user engagement and provide an intuitive interface for human feedback.

## 2. Scope
### Actions to Train
#### Basic Commands
- Sit, Stay, Come.
#### Advanced Commands
- Fetch, Roll Over, Play Dead.
#### Interactive Behaviors
- Respond to virtual environmental changes and interact with virtual objects or other pets.

### Criteria for Successful Action
- **Accuracy:** Correct performance of actions in response to commands.
- **Consistency:** Regular, correct performance over time.
- **Adaptability:** Ability to modify responses based on different cues or environments.

### RL and Human Feedback Integration
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Implement a reward system for learning through trial and error.
- **Human Feedback:** Allow users to provide direct feedback (praise or correction) influencing the pet's learning.
- **Feedback Loop:** A system for RL algorithm adaptation based on human feedback.

## 3. Deliverables
- **A Virtual Pet Simulation:** A software application for training and interacting with the pet.
- **Training Module:** A user-friendly interface for human feedback and progress monitoring.
- **Performance Reports:** Regular updates on the petâ€™s learning, highlighting achievements and areas for improvement.

## 4. Challenges and Considerations
- **Balancing RL and Human Feedback:** Optimize the combination of RL and human input.
- **User Experience:** Create an engaging and intuitive user interface.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Ensure the virtual pet's behavior is responsible and non-harmful.

## 5. Metrics for Success
- **Learning Speed:** Rate at which the virtual pet acquires new behaviors.
- **Behavioral Accuracy:** Precision in responding to commands.
- **User Satisfaction:** User feedback on their training and interaction experience.
